# 💼 cowork

Cowork is a demo project built using React, with the aim of creating a website where users can search for and register coworking spaces.

### 🤝 Use case

Imagine you're a remote worker who has just moved to a new city and you're looking for a coworking space. You search the internet and find that there is no central site to search and compare coworking spaces. You have to check each site individually to find the one that suits your needs. The idea behind Cowork is to collect data from different coworking spaces and present it in a single place for users to easily find and compare spaces.

## 🚀 Quick start

To start the local server:

```sh
> cd backend
> yarn && yarn dev    # install dependecies and run the app
```

```sh
> cd cowork
> yarn && yarn start    # install dependecies and run the app
```
