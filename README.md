# cowork

This is a demo project on React. The idea is to build a website to search or register a coworking spaces.

### Use case
Imagine you have a remote job and decide to live in a new city and you would like to find a cowrking space. When doing a search on the internet there is not a central site to search and compare them. You have to check page by page which is the most convinient for you. 
The idea is collect all the data from different coworking spaces and show it to the users. 


## Quick start
To start the local server:

```sh
> cd backend
> yarn && yarn start    # install dependecies and run the app 
```

To start the React app:

```sh
> cd cowork
> yarn && yarn start    # install dependecies and run the app 
```
